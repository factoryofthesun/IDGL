# iGen: implicit Generation and Generalization with Meta-Learned Text Conditioning 

---

A pytorch implementation of iGen. This project uses many ideas from the text-to-3D model **Dreamfusion**, powered by the [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) text-to-2D model. 

Code here has been developped upon code taken from [ashawkey](https://github.com/ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion).

The original paper's project page: [_DreamFusion: Text-to-3D using 2D Diffusion_](https://dreamfusion3d.github.io/).

This project is a **work-in-progress**. Many features are still not implemented now.
